* documentation!!
* Better tests
* Template aggegator policy
* Serialization
* add predicated construction library
* add finally
* handle recursion in flat reports
* typedefs for ptrs
* Custom profilers - for when users want to profile certain stuff outside of the automatic thread-local profiler
* Unordered profilers - they still generate reports but don't use a stack of nodes because enter and leave may not strictly follow each other
